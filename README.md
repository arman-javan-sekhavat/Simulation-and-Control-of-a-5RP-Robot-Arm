Simulation and Control of a 5RP Robot Arm

This repository includes 3D models, MJCF files and the code for simulating and controlling a 6-DoF robot arm
using the MuJoCo and JAX libraries. The following algorithms are implemented:

1) Forward Kinematics
2) Inverse Kinematics
3) Inverse Dynamics (utilizing both Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations)
4) Trajectory Generation (Cubic and Quintic methods)
5) Linear IJC (Independent Joint Control)
6) CTM (Computed Torque Method)
7) TJ (Transpose Jacobian)
8) MTJ (Modified Transpose Jacobian)
